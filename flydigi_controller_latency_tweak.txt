# Flydigi Controller Latency Tuning

1. Update firmware via Flydigi Game Center.
2. Set USB polling rate = 1000 Hz.
3. Device Manager → USB Controllers → disable power saving.
4. Use TimerResolution to lock 0.5 ms.
5. Optional: use ISLC with refresh-rate matching.

Rollback: re-enable power saving, close apps.
